### Description

Using Excel I was able to create a dynamic dashboard that shared insights into sales performance by coffee shop location. This can be used by stakeholders to make strategic decisions such as opening hours, product selection and more. The initial insights that I found from using the dashboard are found below as well as a screenshot of the dashboard. The link to view the excel file is below too.

The objective of this project was to create a dashboard that provides insights by location, including:

- **Transactions:**
    - By hour
    - By day of the week
    - By product category
- **Revenue:**
    - By month
- **Summary:**
    - Transactions and Revenue by Product
- **Recommendations:**
    - Based on the insights gathered

This dashboard allows stakeholders to gain a clear understanding of each location’s performance.

### Dataset

The full dataset is linked here [Link](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&pageSize=10&search=coffee%20shop%20sales)

149,116 entries, total 11 columns

### Tech-stack + Libraries

- Excel
- Pivot Tables & Dashboard

### Initial Insights

- Lower Manhattan makes less than €150 from 7pm to 8pm, and should consider closing shop at that time
- Hell's kitchen is the only shop to open at 6am but they make less than €1700 during that first hour. They also make less than €550 during it's final hour at 8pm, and should consider adjusting their opening hours
- Hot chocolate at the Astoria location is particularly profitable, generating more revenue per sale than other items so you should consider adjusting marketing efforts.
